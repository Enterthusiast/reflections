When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To work collaboratively, to have a backup if my hard drive crash or when working on the same project from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Perhaps I don't want an updated version of the remote
- Or I don't want to deal with potential new bugs coming from the remote
- I'd rather have my feature working before pulling changes
- If it ain't pbroken don't update it? ^^

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- A Fork is like a clone but on github, it does also give credit to the "cloned" remote author, and allow to send the author "suggestion" commit.
- A clone is a duplicate of a git repository in its actual state, there is no link between a clone and the cloned repository.
- A branch is part of a repository, remote or clone, and is where modification are commited. Multiple branches allows for flexibility (and cooperation) when working on new features, keeping the master branch up and running.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- It helps to do more work offline
- It allows to do diffs and other command to understand what have been changed

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- I guess i would use another tool of version control.
- I would miss the branch and pull request features and I should be double careful and organized when working on new features.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- I make change in a new branch when experimenting or proposing new things
- I make change in a new branch when creating new features
- I make change directly in master when fixing a bug
- I make change directly in master when doing small changes
- I make change directly in master when starting my project
